# Reflection: 

Before reading the article and watching the video, I was under the impression that UX Design was a process spearheaded solely by website developers and coders. Now, I have learned that UX Design is a collaborative process that actually involves many people with different backgrounds.Visual designers, for example, can be apart of the UX Design process and can work with coders to achieve desired visual aesthetics of a website or app. I have also realized that UX is not always just one specific phase of the design process of an app, but it is a way of thinking and therefore can and should be incorporated into all the stages of building digital products and sites.  


# Questions for Alesha:
(1) What strategies do you implement when thinking about the UX design for new projects?

(2) What advice do you have for someone who is interested in the UX field but isn't a strong coder or doesn't have much experience in the field?
