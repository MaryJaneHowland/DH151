The site’s agenda is to detail information related to California railways. The map includes outlines of where railway systems are located / where they run through and where railway stations are. There are options for the user to choose which rail systems they would like to see, such as Amtrak lines or BART lines.

This website speaks to me because I like how it includes a level of viewer engagement/interaction. By clicking the side button options, I feel more involved in the process. I hope to learn how to implement a technique like this into one of my own maps that I build in this class. 

When people click on the different button options, different things happen on the map. For example, if someone clicks on “Amtrak Bus Stations” the names of all bus stations appear according to where they are located. If someone clicks on “Intercity Passenger Rail Routes,” a yellow line appears where those routes are. I think that for the most part, this technique is effective, but the lines and graphics don’t stand out very much. Ultimately, it does what it is supposed to do but the site builders may want to make adjustments to the colors of the graphics and thickness of the lines, or do something to make them more visible.

The technology used to make this map is ArcGis. 

As mentioned before, the graphics are a little hard to view, so I would make the colors of the graphics/lines brighter, and the thickness of the lines a little thicker. I think it would also be interesting if there was added movement to the map. Maybe if you click on one of the buttons, it zoomed in on the relevant area (where the railway stations or routes were), if the area was small enough that is.
